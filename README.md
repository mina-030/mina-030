## Hi there 👋

I’m **Man Leung (Mina)** — a software developer based in the U.S.

I build tools that improve people’s lives (and also fun side projects). This is where I share my ideas and ship projects.

**Tech stack:** Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL  
**Focus:** clean code, maintainability, and code quality

I believe good code is like a poem — clear, simple, and easy to understand. I’m always improving.

Feel free to connect if you’d like to collaborate or have feedback!
Have a good day!
